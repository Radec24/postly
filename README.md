### Project Purpose
Postly was a simple experiment to understand and explore social network design. I was intrigued by the possibility of creating a platform that focuses on ease of use, a clean design, and an inclusive space for sharing ideas. While Postly is just my small contribution to the vast world of social networking, it has the potential to offer a unique experience for its users.

### Tech Stack
The development of Postly involved various technologies. Here's what was used:
* **Backend:** Java 17, Spring Boot (3.0.6 version), Spring MVC, Spring Data, Spring Security, Spring Boot Starter Mail
* **Database:** MySQL (containerized via Docker)
* **Testing:** JUnit, Mockito, Spring Boot Test Slices
* **Frontend:** Thymeleaf, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript
* **Build Tools:** Apache Maven
* **CI/CD:** Jenkins (containerized via Docker), SonarQube (containerized via Docker)
* **Development Plugins:** JPA Buddy, Lombok (These plugins simplify development by aiding in tasks like accessing the database and reducing boilerplate code.)

### Future Plans
As the sole developer of Postly, I have several exciting features planned for the future to enhance user experience further:

* **Cloud migration:** I plan to go live on AWS's robust cloud infrastructure for enhanced scalability and performance.
* **Engagement features:** I want to add a likes and dislikes feature for posts and comments to give users more ways to express their reactions.
* **Post categories:** To help users navigate content more easily, I plan to introduce tags for posts representing their category within the network.
* **Visual content:** I'm working on adding the ability for users to attach images to their posts.
